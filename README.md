# PyTorch-Lesson-6

Things we will learn in this lesson:

    - We will be moving ahead from single hiddenlayer network to deep neural network building 
    - How to automate Deep neural network code creation with too many hidden layers?
    - How to apply regularization using "DROPOUT"
    - differnt types of initialization method in pytorch
    - Batch normalization in pytorch
